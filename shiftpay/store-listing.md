## Full Description

```
You work the shifts. You deserve to know if you're paid correctly.

If you work shifts in healthcare, retail, hospitality, or any job with evening, night, weekend, and holiday supplements — you know the problem. Your payslip is a wall of numbers. The systems are closed. Your history disappears after a month. And when something looks off, you have no way to check.

ShiftPay fixes that.

HOW IT WORKS

1. Import your timesheet
Snap a photo of your printed schedule — ShiftPay reads it automatically using AI-powered OCR. You can also import from a CSV file, or add shifts manually.

2. Set your pay rates
Enter your base hourly rate and any supplements: evening, night, weekend, holiday, overtime. Your rates, your numbers.

3. See what you should earn
ShiftPay calculates your expected pay for any period. Compare it against your actual payslip. If the numbers don't match, now you know.

BUILT FOR PRIVACY

ShiftPay stores everything on your device. No account needed. No cloud. No data collection. Your shifts, your rates, your pay — it stays on your phone.

The only time data leaves your device is when you use the photo import feature. The image is sent to a secure server for text recognition, processed immediately, and deleted. Nothing is stored.

WHO IS THIS FOR?

Shift workers who want to take control of their pay. Nurses, care workers, retail staff, hotel employees, warehouse workers — anyone whose payslip includes complex supplements and who wants a simple way to double-check the math.

You shouldn't need a spreadsheet to know if you're paid right.

## Strategic Notes

**Voice & tone:** Conversational and direct. The reader is someone who feels frustrated and powerless about their pay situation. The copy validates that feeling ("you know the problem") and positions the app as a straightforward tool, not a corporate product.

**Structure:** The description leads with the reader's problem, then walks through the solution in 3 clear steps. Features are listed for scanners. Privacy gets its own section because it's a genuine differentiator and trust-builder for an app that handles financial data.

**What was avoided:**
- No hype words ("revolutionary", "best", "amazing")
- No feature dumps without context
- No "we" language — the reader is the subject throughout
- No generic CTAs — the description trusts the reader to decide

**SEO keywords integrated naturally:** shift worker, payslip, timesheet, OCR, pay rates, overtime, supplements, evening/night/weekend shifts, CSV import, privacy.
