# Scenarios: Daily 60-Second Wellness Check for Healthcare Workers

> Generated: 2026-02-13 | Personas: 6 | Scenarios: 5

## The Idea in One Sentence
A 60-second shift-compatible wellness check-in for healthcare workers that combines validated resilience scoring with immediate, evidence-based self-compassion nudges — designed for the reality of 12-hour shifts, not 9-5 office life.

## Persona Gallery

### Kari, 34
> Intensivsykepleier, nattskift, to barn under 6 år
- **Tech level**: Competent — uses iPhone daily, comfortable with apps, not a power user
- **The moment**: 30 minutes before shift ends at 06:30, in break room after 12 hours in ICU
- **Current solution**: Screenshots text messages to friends saying "rough night," scrolls Instagram to decompress, drinks too much coffee
- **Feeling**: Exhausted, emotionally wrung out, guilty about waking up partner when she gets home
- **Success = **: "I felt like someone saw me. I did the small thing it suggested and it actually helped."

---

### Lars, 29
> Lege i turnus, akuttmottaket, Bærum sykehus
- **Tech level**: Power user — builds shortcuts, quantified-self enthusiast, tracks everything
- **The moment**: Between patients during a chaotic Friday afternoon, 45 minutes until shift change
- **Current solution**: Mental checklist of "am I okay?", occasionally writes in Notes app, tries to meditate but falls asleep
- **Feeling**: Wired but tired, running on adrenaline, knows he should check in with himself but doesn't have a system
- **Success = **: "I can see patterns I didn't notice before. The data helps me catch problems early."

---

### Ingrid, 52
> Hjelpepleier, sykehjem, fast dagvakt
- **Tech level**: Basic — uses phone for calls/texts/photos, resistant to "complicated apps"
- **The moment**: Lunch break after morning rounds, sitting in staff room with half-eaten yogurt
- **Current solution**: Vents to colleagues (who are equally burned out), goes outside for 5 minutes if weather permits
- **Feeling**: Tired but functional, worried she's "too old for this," doesn't want to complain
- **Success = **: "It didn't take long. I didn't have to think too hard. It felt gentle."

---

### Bjorn, 41
> Ambulanseparamedic, 24-hour shifts, rural coverage
- **Tech level**: Moderate — uses apps for work (shift scheduling, GPS), skeptical of "wellness stuff"
- **The moment**: 3am, parked at station between calls, can't sleep, partner is snoring in the bunk
- **Current solution**: Stares at ceiling, scrolls news, texts wife if she's awake, worries about the call from earlier
- **Feeling**: Haunted, can't turn his brain off, doesn't want to burden his team with "feelings talk"
- **Success = **: "It didn't feel like therapy. It felt practical. I could do it without anyone knowing."

---

### Amina, 27
> Nyutdannet sykepleier, roterende skift, kirurgisk avdeling
- **Tech level**: High — Gen Z digital native, uses TikTok/Instagram/wellness apps, expects good UX
- **The moment**: After a patient died unexpectedly on her shift, sitting in car before driving home
- **Current solution**: Calls best friend, posts vague stories on Instagram, doom-scrolls to avoid feeling
- **Feeling**: Shaken, questioning if she's cut out for this, afraid to look weak in front of senior nurses
- **Success = **: "It didn't try to fix me. It just helped me name what I was feeling and gave me one small thing to do."

---

### Morten, 58
> Overlege, onkologisk avdeling, 37 år i yrket
- **Tech level**: Low — uses email reluctantly, prefers paper, "apps are for young people"
- **The moment**: End of clinic day after telling three families their loved ones have terminal diagnoses
- **Current solution**: Sits in his office with the door closed for 10 minutes, drives home in silence, drinks whisky
- **Feeling**: Numb, carrying 37 years of accumulated grief, convinced he should just "handle it"
- **Success = **: "I didn't think this was for me. But after 6 weeks, I realized I was sleeping better."

## Scenario 1: Kari — "The 6am Check-In"

### The Setup
Kari pulls off her gloves and drops into the plastic chair in the ICU break room. 06:02. Her shift ends in 28 minutes but she can't leave until the day shift nurse gets report. She's been on her feet for 11 hours. Bed 3 coded twice tonight. Bed 7's family is angry about wait times. Her lower back is screaming and there's a coffee stain on her scrubs from 4am that she doesn't remember getting.

She pulls out her phone. Three unread texts from her partner asking if she's okay (sent at 02:30, she never answered). A notification from the wellness app: "Morning, Kari. 60 seconds for a check-in?"

She almost swipes it away. But her hand is already tired and the notification is right there. Big button. "Start Check-In." One thumb. She taps it.

### The Trigger
She's been using this app for three weeks. It never pings her during sleep windows (she told it she works 19:00-07:00 Wednesday/Thursday/Friday, sleeps 09:00-16:00). It always catches her right here — 30 minutes before shift end, when she has just enough mental space to think but not enough energy to resist.

The app knows: this is the moment healthcare workers can breathe. Not mid-shift when a patient could crash. Not immediately post-shift when you're racing to get home. Right here. The liminal space.

### The Interaction
**Screen 1 (3 seconds)**: "How resilient do you feel right now?"
Five big circles, 1-5. She taps 2. No thinking required.

**Screen 2 (4 seconds)**: "I bounce back quickly from difficult times."
Slider: Strongly Disagree ← → Strongly Agree
She drags it left. One-thumb operation, her coffee is in her other hand.

**Screen 3 (3 seconds)**: "How's your mood?"
Seven emoji faces from miserable to delighted. She taps the "meh/flat" face. Fourth from left.

**Screen 4 (4 seconds)**: "How did you sleep before this shift?"
Four options: "Well" / "Okay" / "Poorly" / "Didn't sleep"
She taps "Okay." The kids woke her up twice yesterday afternoon but she got maybe 5 hours.

**Screen 5 (2 seconds)**: Little animation — a glowing circle pulsing gently. "Calculating your Resilience Score..."

**Screen 6 (8 seconds)**: "Your Resilience Score: 42/100"
A small graph shows the last two weeks. She's trending down — she was at 58 last Wednesday. The line is dropping.

Below: "You're running on fumes, Kari. Here's something small."

**Screen 7 (30 seconds)**: The nudge.

> "Before you give report to the day nurse, name ONE thing you did well tonight."
>
> Not what went wrong. Not what you could have done better. One thing you did well.
>
> Say it out loud or write it down. Doesn't matter if it's small.

A button: "I did this"
Another button: "Not right now"

She stares at the screen. Her first instinct is "I didn't do anything well, the shift was chaos." But then she remembers: when Bed 3 coded the second time, she caught the potassium level before the resident and probably saved 10 minutes. She didn't freeze. She moved.

She doesn't tap either button yet. She just sits there. The app isn't nagging her. It's not counting down. It's just... there.

Her colleague walks in. "You okay?"

Kari locks her phone. "Yeah. Just need a minute."

Total time: 56 seconds from notification tap to putting phone down.

### The Outcome
Kari doesn't say the thing out loud. Not yet. But when she walks back to give report, she mentions to the day nurse: "Bed 3 had a rough night but we caught the K+ early on the second code. Team did good."

The day nurse nods, distracted, already scanning the charts.

But Kari heard herself say it. "Team did good." That includes her.

On her drive home, she doesn't text her friends about how brutal the shift was. She still feels exhausted. Her back still hurts. But there's a tiny shift — a 2mm movement — from "I survived another nightmare" to "I did my job and I did it well."

She opens the app before she walks in the door. Taps "I did this." The app shows a little animation: "3-day streak of self-compassion. Keep going, Kari."

She doesn't feel transformed. But she feels... seen. By herself, for once.

### Without This Product
Kari would have texted her friends: "Another shit shift. I hate this job sometimes."

They'd respond with heart emojis and "you're amazing" which would feel nice but hollow because they don't know what happened.

She'd walk in the door, wake up her partner accidentally, feel guilty, crawl into bed, lie awake replaying the things that went wrong, fall asleep at 09:30, wake up at 14:00 feeling unrested.

The Resilience Score of 42 — dropping from 58 two weeks ago — would be invisible. She wouldn't notice she's trending toward burnout until she's crying in the parking lot before a shift in three months.

The pattern would continue. Every week, a little more numb. A little more "just surviving."

---

## Scenario 2: Bjorn — "The 3am Haunting"

### The Setup
The ambulance station is quiet except for the hum of the fridge and his partner's snoring from the bunk room. Bjorn is lying on the narrow cot, still in his uniform pants, boots off, staring at the ceiling tiles. 03:17.

They ran a call four hours ago. Teenage girl, car accident, ejected from vehicle. They got her to the hospital alive. Barely. The sound her mother made when they wheeled her daughter past — Bjorn can't unhear it.

He knows he won't sleep. His brain is doing the thing it does: replaying every decision. Should we have intubated on scene? Did I miss something? The IV took three tries, was that too long?

He pulls out his phone. Scrolls news. Horrible. Scrolls Reddit. Worse. Opens Instagram. His wife posted a photo of their dog. He double-taps it, feels nothing.

A notification slides down from the top: "Can't sleep? 60 seconds to check in."

The app learned his schedule after two weeks. 24-hour shifts, Wednesday and Saturday. Sleep windows are chaos — sometimes he sleeps 22:00-04:00, sometimes not at all. The app stopped trying to predict sleep and started asking: "Are you awake right now and need this?"

He almost dismisses it. But his thumb is already moving.

### The Trigger
Bjorn is a 41-year-old man who's spent 19 years in emergency medicine. He doesn't talk about feelings. He definitely doesn't use "wellness apps."

But three weeks ago, his wife saw him zoning out during dinner for the third night in a row and said, "You're not okay. I need you to try something."

She'd read about this app in a nursing forum. "It's not therapy. It's just... a check-in. 60 seconds. You track data. You like data."

She was right. He does like data. And right now, at 3am, haunted by a teenager's mother screaming, he needs something to do that isn't scrolling.

### The Interaction
**Screen 1**: "How resilient do you feel right now?"
He taps 2. Low. He feels like tissue paper.

**Screen 2**: "I bounce back quickly from difficult times."
He drags the slider left. Not tonight.

**Screen 3**: "How's your mood?"
He taps the anxious/sad emoji. Second from left.

**Screen 4**: "Did you sleep in the last 6 hours?"
"No"

**Screen 5**: Animation. "Calculating your Resilience Score..."

**Screen 6**: "Your Resilience Score: 38/100"

The graph shows he's been in the 35-45 range for two weeks. Not terrible, not great. But there's a note: "You've had 4 nights with no sleep in the last 7 days. Your score drops 15 points when you don't sleep."

It's not judging him. It's just showing him the pattern.

**Screen 7**: The nudge.

> "You can't fix what happened tonight. But you can name it."
>
> Right now, say out loud (or think clearly): "That call was hard. I did my job. I can't carry what isn't mine to carry."
>
> You don't have to believe it. Just say it.

Button: "I did this"
Button: "Not right now"

Bjorn reads it twice. His first reaction: "This is bullshit self-help nonsense."

His second reaction: But what else am I going to do for the next three hours?

He whispers it into the dark. "That call was hard." His voice cracks. "I did my job."

He doesn't say the third sentence out loud. He's not ready.

But he taps "I did this."

### The Outcome
Bjorn doesn't fall asleep. But at 04:30, when his brain starts the replay again, he catches himself. "I already named this. I did my job."

The loop doesn't stop completely. But it's shorter. He gets maybe 90 minutes of sleep before the next call comes in at 06:15.

A week later, he's in the same situation — bad call, can't sleep. The app gives him a different nudge: "Text one person who wasn't there and say: 'Rough shift. I'm okay but I needed to say it out loud.' Send it now."

He texts his wife. "Rough shift. I'm okay but I needed to say it out loud."

She responds immediately: "I'm here. Love you."

He falls asleep at 04:00.

After six weeks, his Resilience Score stabilizes at 52. Not high. But stable. The app shows him the correlation: on weeks when he uses the "name it" nudge after bad calls, his score holds. On weeks when he doesn't, it drops to the mid-30s.

He starts using it after every hard call. Not because he believes in wellness apps. Because the data shows it works.

### Without This Product
Bjorn would lie awake until his next shift started. He'd function — he's a professional — but the cumulative weight of unnamed trauma would build.

In three months, he'd snap at his partner over something small. In six months, he'd start dreading shifts. In a year, he'd be on antidepressants or looking for a desk job.

He'd never connect the dots between "no sleep after bad calls" and "Resilience Score dropping." He'd just know he felt like shit and couldn't figure out why.

The idea that 60 seconds of naming the thing — "that call was hard, I did my job" — could interrupt the spiral? He'd never discover it on his own.

## Scenario 3: Amina — "The Parking Lot Breakdown"

### The Setup
Amina sits in her car in the hospital parking garage, engine off, hands still gripping the steering wheel. 15:47. Her shift ended 17 minutes ago but she can't make herself drive yet.

Mr. Johansen died. He wasn't supposed to die — post-op day 2, routine appendectomy, 34 years old, two kids. But he threw a pulmonary embolism and arrested and they coded him for 40 minutes and called it at 15:12.

Amina was the one doing compressions when they called it. She was the one who had to step back and stop.

She's been a nurse for 11 months. This is her third patient death, but the first one that was sudden. The first one where she really thought they'd bring him back.

Her hands are shaking. She pulls out her phone to call her best friend, but then she sees the time — her friend is at work, she can't dump this on her right now.

She opens Instagram. Starts to type a Story: "Some days this job is—"

Stops. Deletes it. She doesn't want to perform her grief for 400 followers.

A notification: "Shift just ended? 60 seconds to check in."

The app knows her schedule: rotating shifts, 07:00-15:00 today, 15:00-23:00 tomorrow, two days off, then night shift. It pings her 15-30 minutes after shift end, right when most healthcare workers are sitting in their cars trying to transition back to human.

### The Trigger
Amina downloaded this app in week 3 of her first job. A senior nurse recommended it during orientation: "You're going to see hard things. This helps you process without drowning."

She's been using it for 8 months. Some days she taps through it mechanically — fine, fine, good mood, slept well, done. Other days she actually reads the nudges.

Today she needs it.

### The Interaction
**Screen 1**: "How resilient do you feel right now?"
She taps 1. The lowest option. She feels like she's made of glass.

**Screen 2**: "I bounce back quickly from difficult times."
She drags the slider all the way left. Strongly disagree. She doesn't feel like she'll ever bounce back from this.

**Screen 3**: "How's your mood?"
She taps the crying emoji. Far left.

**Screen 4**: "How did you sleep before this shift?"
"Well" — she did sleep well. Last night was fine. This morning she woke up feeling okay. And now this.

**Screen 5**: Animation. Longer than usual — the app is calculating.

**Screen 6**: "Your Resilience Score: 28/100"

The graph shows a sharp drop — she was at 64 yesterday.

Below the score: "This is a hard day, Amina. What you're feeling is real."

Not "stay positive." Not "you've got this." Just: what you're feeling is real.

**Screen 7**: The nudge.

> "You can't process this in 60 seconds. But you can take one breath."
>
> Right now:
> - Put one hand on your chest
> - Breathe in for 4 counts, out for 6 counts
> - Do this 3 times
>
> You don't have to feel better. You just have to breathe.

Button: "I did this"
Button: "Not right now"

Amina doesn't want to do it. She wants to call someone, to cry, to scream, to quit.

But her hand is on her chest. And she's breathing. 4 counts in. 6 counts out.

On the third breath, she starts crying. Not sobbing — just tears running down her face, silent, the kind of crying that's been waiting all shift.

She taps "I did this."

### The Outcome
A second screen appears:

> "You just survived something hard. Here's what helps next:
>
> - Call someone who loves you (even if you just say 'bad day, can't talk yet, love you')
> - Don't go straight home if home is empty — stop somewhere public for 10 minutes (coffee shop, park, grocery store)
> - Drink water, eat something, even if you're not hungry
>
> You can look at your score again tomorrow. Right now, just do one of these three things."

Amina sits in the car for another 5 minutes. Then she drives to the coffee shop near her apartment, orders a latte, sits in the corner, and texts her best friend: "Bad day. Patient died. Can't talk yet but I needed to tell you. Love you."

Her friend responds: "I'm here. Call me tonight or tomorrow or whenever. Love you."

Amina drinks her latte. She doesn't feel better. But she doesn't feel alone.

That night, she opens the app again. Her Resilience Score is still 28. But there's a note: "After hard days, scores stay low for 2-3 days. This is normal. You're not broken."

Over the next week, her score climbs back to 58. Not as high as before (64), but stable. The app shows her the pattern: after patient deaths, her score drops 30-40 points, then recovers over 5-7 days.

Knowing the pattern helps. The next time a patient dies (there will be a next time), she'll know: this is the drop. It will come back. I'm not broken.

### Without This Product
Amina would have sat in the parking garage for 40 minutes, spiraling. She'd drive home crying, unsafe. She'd walk into her empty apartment, lie on the couch, doom-scroll for three hours, skip dinner, go to bed at 22:00, lie awake replaying the code.

She'd text her friend eventually, maybe that night, maybe the next day. But the window when she needed immediate support — those first 30 minutes after the shift — would pass.

She wouldn't know that her Resilience Score dropped from 64 to 28. She wouldn't know that this is a predictable pattern. She'd just know she felt destroyed and assume that means she's weak or not cut out for nursing.

In three months, after two more patient deaths, she'd be job-hunting. "Maybe I should do outpatient. Maybe I'm not strong enough for this."

The app doesn't make patient deaths easier. But it makes the aftermath survivable.

## Scenario 4: Morten — "The Skeptic Who Stayed"

### The Setup
Morten closes the door to his office and sits heavily in his chair. 16:45. His last patient left 10 minutes ago — the third family today he had to tell that treatment isn't working, that it's time to talk about hospice, that we're out of options.

He's 58 years old. He's been an oncologist for 37 years. He's had this conversation approximately 4,000 times.

It doesn't get easier.

He opens his laptop to finish notes, but his hands are hovering over the keyboard and nothing is happening. His brain is blank. Not tired — blank. He calls this "the fog." It's been happening more often in the last two years.

His daughter, who's a nurse, set up this app on his phone six months ago during a visit. "Far, you need to take care of yourself. Just try it for one month."

He humored her. He's a doctor; he understands the research on burnout. But he didn't expect to still be using it six months later.

The app pings. He's trained it to only notify him at 16:00-17:00 on clinic days, never on surgical days, never on weekends.

### The Trigger
Morten doesn't think of himself as someone who "does self-care." He works, he goes home, he drinks whisky, he sleeps poorly, he comes back.

But two months into using the app, he noticed something in the data: on weeks when he skipped check-ins, his sleep got worse. On weeks when he did them, he slept 6 hours instead of 4.

He's a scientist. He likes evidence. The evidence said: this thing works, even if you don't understand why.

So he kept doing it.

### The Interaction
**Screen 1**: "How resilient do you feel right now?"
He taps 3. Middle. Functional but depleted.

**Screen 2**: "I bounce back quickly from difficult times."
He drags it slightly left of center. He bounces back. It just takes longer than it used to.

**Screen 3**: "How's your mood?"
He taps the neutral face. Not sad, not happy. Blank.

**Screen 4**: "How did you sleep last night?"
"Poorly" — he woke up at 02:30 and couldn't fall back asleep.

**Screen 5**: "Your Resilience Score: 51/100"

He's been in the 48-55 range for six months. Stable. Not high, but stable.

The app shows him a note: "You've maintained a steady score for 6 months. That's resilience."

**Screen 7**: The nudge.

> "You've carried a lot today. You'll carry more tomorrow."
>
> Before you leave your office:
> - Close your eyes for 10 seconds
> - Name one patient you helped today (not the ones you couldn't save — one you helped)
> - Write their initials on a piece of paper, fold it, put it in your pocket
>
> Carry that instead of the weight."

He reads it. His first instinct: this is sentimental nonsense.

But his eyes are already closed.

He thinks about the woman this morning — early-stage breast cancer, surgery went well, good prognosis. He told her family she'd be okay. They cried with relief.

He writes "A.L." on a Post-it note. Folds it. Puts it in his jacket pocket.

### The Outcome
Morten doesn't feel transformed. But when he's driving home and his brain starts replaying the three hard conversations, he touches the folded Post-it in his pocket.

A.L. is alive. A.L. is going to be okay. He helped.

That night, he sleeps 6 hours. Not great, but better.

Over six months, this pattern holds: on days when he does the check-in and follows the nudge, he sleeps better. The app tracks it. After 90 days, it shows him a graph: "Sleep quality correlates with self-compassion nudges. Effect size: +40 minutes average per night."

He doesn't tell his colleagues he uses a wellness app. But when a younger doctor mentions burning out, Morten says, quietly, "There's this app my daughter uses. It's... not terrible."

The younger doctor downloads it.

### Without This Product
Morten would sit in his office staring at his laptop for 20 minutes. He'd finish his notes. He'd drive home in the fog. He'd drink whisky. He'd sleep 4 hours. He'd come back.

In two years, he'd retire early. Not because he wanted to, but because he couldn't carry it anymore.

He'd never connect the dots between "sleep quality" and "taking 60 seconds to name one patient I helped." He'd just know he felt increasingly numb and assume that's what 37 years in oncology does to you.

The idea that resilience is a practice, not a personality trait? He'd never believe it without the data.

## Scenario 5: Ingrid — "The One Who Almost Didn't Try"

### The Setup
Ingrid sits in the staff room with her half-eaten yogurt, scrolling Facebook on her phone. 11:30. Lunch break. 30 minutes before afternoon medication rounds.

Morning was rough. Three residents with dementia had a bad day — one hit her, one screamed for two hours, one kept trying to leave the building. Her back hurts. Her knees hurt. She's 52 and starting to wonder how many more years she can do this.

Her daughter (who works in tech) installed this app on her phone last month. "Mamma, it's really simple. You just tap a few buttons. It helps."

Ingrid is skeptical. She's not "an app person." She uses her phone for calls, texts, and photos of her grandkids. That's it.

But her daughter set it up so there's a big widget on her home screen. One tap and it opens.

She's been ignoring it for three weeks.

Today, she's tired enough to try anything.

### The Trigger
Ingrid doesn't believe wellness apps are for people like her. They're for young people who do yoga and drink smoothies.

But this morning, one of her colleagues broke down crying in the hallway. Burnout. She's going on sick leave.

Ingrid thought: I can't afford to break down. I have 13 years until retirement. I have to make it.

Maybe the app could help. Maybe.

### The Interaction
She taps the widget. It opens immediately — no login, no loading screen, just straight to the check-in.

**Screen 1**: "How resilient do you feel right now?"
Big circles, 1-5. She taps 3. She's fine. She's always fine.

**Screen 2**: "I bounce back quickly from difficult times."
A slider. She drags it to the middle. She does bounce back. It just takes longer than it used to.

**Screen 3**: "How's your mood?"
Emoji faces. She taps the tired/neutral one.

**Screen 4**: "How did you sleep last night?"
"Okay" — she slept fine, but her knees woke her up twice.

**Screen 5**: "Your Resilience Score: 58/100"

She doesn't know if that's good or bad. But there's a little note: "First check-in! We'll track this over time so you can see patterns."

**Screen 7**: The nudge.

> "You've been taking care of people all morning. Here's 30 seconds for you."
>
> Right now:
> - Stand up
> - Roll your shoulders back three times
> - Take one deep breath
>
> That's it. You're done."

She reads it and thinks: that's it? That's the whole thing?

She stands up. Rolls her shoulders. They crack. She takes a breath.

She sits back down and taps "I did this."

A message appears: "You just took care of yourself. Same time tomorrow?"

### The Outcome
Ingrid doesn't think about the app again until the next day, when the widget shows a notification: "11:30 — time for your check-in?"

She's in the staff room again. She taps it. Goes through the same questions. This time her score is 54 (she slept poorly). The nudge tells her to drink a glass of water before afternoon rounds.

She does.

After two weeks, she's checked in 9 times. Her score ranges from 52-61. The app shows her a small graph: "You're most resilient on days when you sleep well and take breaks."

This is not new information. But seeing it on a graph makes it real.

After six weeks, she mentions the app to a colleague. "It's really simple. You just tap a few things. Takes one minute."

Her colleague downloads it.

After three months, Ingrid's score is stable at 58-62. She's not less tired. Her knees still hurt. But she's taking 60 seconds a day to check in with herself, and that didn't used to happen.

One day, the app asks: "Would you recommend this to a colleague?"

She taps yes.

### Without This Product
Ingrid would eat her yogurt, scroll Facebook, go back to afternoon rounds. She'd push through until retirement or until her body gave out, whichever came first.

She'd never have language for what she's experiencing. She'd just call it "being tired" and assume that's what happens when you're 52 and work in healthcare.

The idea that resilience is trackable, that small actions (roll your shoulders, drink water) add up — she'd never encounter it.

She'd watch her colleagues burn out one by one and think: I hope that's not me. But I don't know how to make sure it's not.

---

## Insights

### Core Interaction Pattern
The essential action is **a 60-second emotional check-in at a vulnerable transition moment (end of shift, break, 3am insomnia) that immediately delivers one micro-action the user can do RIGHT NOW.**

It's not "track your feelings and hope." It's "track your feelings, see the pattern, do one small thing immediately."

### Critical Moments Where the Experience Could Break

1. **Notification timing** — If the app pings during sleep or mid-shift, it's uninstalled. Shift-aware timing is non-negotiable.

2. **Nudge relevance** — If the nudge feels generic ("practice gratitude!") instead of specific to healthcare context ("name one thing you did well in your shift"), trust breaks.

3. **Complexity** — If the check-in takes more than 60 seconds or requires typing, tired healthcare workers will abandon it.

4. **Emotional tone** — If the app is too cheerful ("You've got this! Stay positive!") after a patient dies, it feels insulting. The tone must be gentle, non-judgmental, realistic.

5. **Data validity** — If users track their score for 3 months and see no patterns or insights, they'll question if it's real or just made-up numbers.

### Frequency Signal
**Daily to 3-4x per week** — Healthcare workers want this AFTER hard shifts, not necessarily every shift.

Kari (night shifts 3x/week) uses it 3x/week.
Bjorn (24-hour shifts 2x/week) uses it 2x/week, sometimes 3x if he can't sleep.
Amina (rotating shifts) uses it 4-5x/week.
Morten (clinic days) uses it 2-3x/week.
Ingrid (daily day shift) uses it 4-5x/week once she builds the habit.

The pattern: **usage correlates with shift difficulty, not shift frequency.** The app must not guilt users for "breaking streaks."

### MVP Signal
The minimum viable product needs to make **Amina's scenario work** (the parking lot breakdown after a patient death).

That means:
- Validated resilience scoring that shows meaningful patterns
- Shift-aware timing (knows when her shift ends)
- Immediate, context-appropriate nudge (not "be grateful," but "breathe, call someone, don't go home to an empty apartment")
- Clear messaging that score drops after trauma are normal and temporary
- One-thumb operation (she's in her car, emotional, barely functional)

If it works for Amina in crisis, it works for Kari on a normal hard shift and Lars tracking patterns.

### Viral Moment
**The moment someone says "my score predicted my breakdown before I noticed it."**

Lars (the data guy) will show his friends the graph: "Look — I dropped from 65 to 42 over three weeks and I didn't even notice until the app flagged it."

Morten (the skeptic) will quietly recommend it to one younger colleague who's struggling.

Ingrid will mention it in the staff room: "It's really simple, just one minute."

The viral moment is NOT social sharing ("look at my Resilience Score!"). It's **one-to-one trusted recommendations from peers who were skeptical and were surprised it worked.**

Healthcare workers don't trust marketing. They trust other healthcare workers who say "I didn't think this was for me, but it helped."

## Day in the Life: Amina (Rotating Shifts, Crisis Day)

| Time | Activity | Product Touchpoint |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| 06:30 | Wake up, get ready for 07:00 shift | — |
| 07:00 | Start shift, surgical ward | — |
| 09:15 | Patient codes unexpectedly | — |
| 09:52 | Code called, patient dies | — |
| 10:00 | Paperwork, avoid thinking | — |
| 12:00 | Lunch break, sits alone | Thinks about checking in but too numb |
| 14:30 | Finish shift tasks, handoff report | — |
| 15:17 | Sitting in car, can't drive yet | **App pings: "Shift just ended? 60 seconds to check in."** |
| 15:18 | Opens app, goes through check-in | **Resilience Score: 28/100 (dropped from 64)** |
| 15:19 | Receives nudge: breathe 3 times | **Does it, starts crying, taps "I did this"** |
| 15:20 | Second screen: guidance for next steps | **Reads: call someone, don't go home if empty, drink water** |
| 15:35 | Drives to coffee shop instead of home | Product influenced this decision |
| 15:40 | Texts best friend: "Bad day, patient died, love you" | Product prompted this action |
| 16:00 | Drinks latte, sits in public space | — |
| 17:00 | Goes home, showers, cries | — |
| 19:00 | Friend calls, they talk for 30 minutes | — |
| 22:00 | Lying in bed, can't sleep | Opens app, looks at score again |
| 22:01 | Reads message: "After hard days, scores stay low 2-3 days. This is normal." | **Feels less broken** |
| 22:15 | Falls asleep | — |

**Next 7 days:**
- Day 2: Checks in after shift, score still low (31), nudge is gentle
- Day 3: Day off, doesn't check in (app doesn't nag)
- Day 4: Checks in after shift, score climbing (44)
- Day 7: Score back to 58, app shows pattern: "Recovery curve after patient loss: 5-7 days"

**Without the product:**
- 15:17: Sits in car spiraling for 40 minutes
- 15:50: Drives home crying, unsafe
- 16:00: Empty apartment, lies on couch doom-scrolling
- 19:00: Still hasn't eaten or called anyone
- 22:00: Texts friend but conversation is shallow, doesn't say what happened
- Next 7 days: Feels broken, doesn't understand why she can't bounce back, questions career choice

## Bottom Line

**Does this product have a natural home in someone's life?**

Yes — but ONLY if it gets the details right.

The natural home is **the liminal space between work-self and human-self.** End of shift in the car. 3am insomnia between calls. Lunch break after a rough morning. The moments when healthcare workers are transitioning and vulnerable and need something but don't have energy for much.

The product works IF:
1. **Timing is perfect** — shift-aware, never intrusive
2. **Check-in is fast** — truly 60 seconds, one-thumb, no typing
3. **Nudges are specific** — healthcare context, not generic wellness
4. **Tone is right** — gentle, realistic, not toxic positivity
5. **Data is valid** — patterns must be real and predictive

The biggest risk: **building a mood tracker that feels like another obligation.**

The biggest opportunity: **being the thing that catches burnout BEFORE the breakdown**, by showing healthcare workers patterns they can't see themselves (score dropping over 3 weeks, correlation between sleep and resilience, predictable recovery curves after trauma).

If Kari looks at her graph after 3 months and says "I was heading for a breakdown and I didn't even see it until the app showed me" — the product wins.

If Bjorn uses it after every hard call because the data proves it helps him sleep — the product wins.

If Amina survives her first patient death without quitting because the app told her "this is normal, you'll recover in 5-7 days, you're not broken" — the product wins.

**Honest assessment:** This is viable, but only with excellent execution. The margin for error is small. Healthcare workers are the toughest audience — burned out, skeptical, time-starved, trauma-exposed. If the product respects their reality (shifts, exhaustion, emotional toll) and delivers real value in 60 seconds, it has a home in their lives. If it asks for too much or delivers too little, it dies in the parking lot after the first try.
