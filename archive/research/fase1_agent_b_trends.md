# Research: Emerging Trends & New Problems (2025-2026)

> Researched: 2026-02-13 | Sources consulted: 45+ | Confidence: High

## TL;DR

The most intense new problems cluster around **AI's unintended consequences** (work intensification, content flooding, FOBO anxiety, tool fatigue) and the **loneliness/community crisis** (third place disappearance, remote work isolation). These are problems that barely existed 3 years ago and are rapidly worsening. The strongest MVP candidates combine high daily pain frequency with clear, underserved user groups.

---

## Problem 1: AI Work Intensification & Burnout Paradox

**Pain level:** 9/10
**Frequency:** Daily
**Trend:** Brand new problem -- UC Berkeley/HBR study published Feb 9, 2026 confirmed this
**Description:** AI tools don't reduce work -- they intensify it. Workers voluntarily take on broader scope, faster pace, and longer hours because AI makes each task "quick." This leads to workload creep, cognitive fatigue, multitasking overload, and burnout. The productivity surge gives way to lower quality work and turnover.
**Source:** [HBR - AI Doesn't Reduce Work, It Intensifies It](https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it) | [Fortune - AI having opposite effect](https://fortune.com/2026/02/10/ai-future-of-work-white-collar-employees-technology-productivity-burnout-research-uc-berkeley/)
**Affected group:** Knowledge workers, especially at tech companies (study: 200 employees at US tech company, April-Dec 2025)
**Current solutions:** Virtually nothing. The researchers recommend "AI practice" norms but no tools exist to help individuals manage this.
**Evidence of growth:** HBR article went viral (Feb 2026). The study shows AI workers managed more active threads, switched attention constantly, checked AI outputs frequently, and expanded working hours -- all without being asked to.

## Problem 2: AI Content Flooding / "AI Slop" Crisis

**Pain level:** 8/10
**Frequency:** Daily
**Trend:** Exponential growth -- "AI slop" was Merriam-Webster Word of the Year 2025; mentions increased 9x from 2024
**Description:** 74.2% of new web pages contain AI-generated content (Ahrefs, April 2025). Experts project 90% AI-generated content online by end of 2026. Search results are degraded, authentic human content is buried, and users can't tell what's real. Publishers losing 20-90% of traffic.
**Source:** [Euronews - AI slop went mainstream](https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/12/28/2025-was-the-year-ai-slop-went-mainstream-is-the-internet-ready-to-grow-up-now) | [Digiday - Authenticity in demand](https://digiday.com/media/after-an-oversaturation-of-ai-generated-content-creators-authenticity-and-messiness-are-in-high-demand/) | [Brand Communicator - 1B AI videos projected](https://brandcom.ng/2026/02/05/top-trends-2026-ai-content-explosion-expected-as-1-billion-ai-generated-videos-projected-to-flood-platforms-in-2026/)
**Affected group:** Everyone who uses the internet; content consumers, researchers, shoppers, students
**Current solutions:** Pinterest/YouTube added "limit AI content" features. Google trying to filter. But no consumer-facing tool helps individuals find authentic, human-created content reliably.
**Evidence of growth:** AI content in Google results went from 7.4% (March 2024) to 19.1% (Jan 2025). Only 26% of consumers prefer AI content (down from 60% in 2023). 1 billion AI-generated videos projected on platforms in 2026.

---

## Problem 3: FOBO - Fear of Becoming Obsolete

**Pain level:** 8/10
**Frequency:** Daily (persistent anxiety)
**Trend:** New term gaining mainstream traction in 2025-2026; Gallup shows 22% of workers fear obsolescence (up from 15% in 2021)
**Description:** Workers feel their skills are degrading in real time. Entry-level learning opportunities disappear as "grunt work" gets automated. 38% worry AI will make their job duties outdated (APA, July 2025). Therapists report surge in AI-related anxiety sessions. 21% have lost a job to AI or know someone who has.
**Source:** [WEF - Rise of FOBO](https://www.weforum.org/videos/ai-fomo-fobo/) | [CNBC - Therapists see more AI anxiety](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/24/ai-artificial-intelligence-worries-therapy.html) | [People Managing People - AI Fears 2026](https://peoplemanagingpeople.com/workforce-management/ai-fears-2026/)
**Affected group:** Knowledge workers, especially juniors/mid-career professionals; 52% of all workers affected
**Current solutions:** Generic upskilling platforms (Coursera, edX). No tool helps individuals assess their actual obsolescence risk, create personalized reskilling plans, or track their progress against market demands.
**Evidence of growth:** Gallup: 15% (2021) -> 22% (2026). APA: 38% worry about job duties becoming outdated. CNBC reports therapist sessions about AI anxiety surging.

---

## Problem 4: AI Tool Fatigue & Decision Paralysis

**Pain level:** 7/10
**Frequency:** Daily/Weekly
**Trend:** Intensifying rapidly -- 71% of workers say AI tools appear faster than they can learn them
**Description:** Too many AI tools, too little clarity. 28% of enterprises use 10+ AI apps. 70% haven't moved beyond basic integration. Workers face decision paralysis choosing which tool to use, evaluative fatigue assessing outputs, and cognitive overload from constant context-switching between AI interfaces. By Wednesday they can't make simple decisions anymore.
**Source:** [IT Pro - AI Fatigue backlash](https://www.itpro.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-fatigue-is-the-backlash-against-ai-already-here) | [Zapier - Tool sprawl survey](https://zapier.com/blog/ai-sprawl-survey/) | [Human Clarity Institute - Cognitive Load Data](https://humanclarityinstitute.com/data/ai-fatigue-decision-2025/)
**Affected group:** Knowledge workers, managers, small business owners trying to adopt AI
**Current solutions:** Comparison sites (G2, Capterra) -- but they add to the noise, not reduce it. No "AI concierge" that matches your actual needs to the right tool.
**Evidence of growth:** 66% of enterprises plan to INCREASE AI tool count. Employee willingness to accept change dropped from 74% (2016) to 43% (2025). 76% experienced negative outcomes from disconnected AI.

---

## Problem 5: Digital Presenteeism

**Pain level:** 7/10
**Frequency:** Daily
**Trend:** Growing with return-to-office mandates creating hybrid tension; new research quantifying the waste
**Description:** Remote/hybrid workers spend an extra 67 minutes per day (5.5 hours/week) performing "visible busyness" -- tapping keyboards, sending unnecessary messages, staying green on Teams -- instead of doing actual work. This reduces meaningful task completion by 27% (HBR). Productivity drops 47% among digital presentees.
**Source:** [We360.ai - Rise of Digital Presenteeism](https://we360.ai/blog/the-rise-of-digital-presenteeism-why-being-online-being-productive) | [Dstny - Digital presenteeism hybrid world](https://www.dstny.com/blog/digital-presenteeism-in-a-hybrid-world-when-being-present-isnt-enough) | [Oyster HR - What is digital presenteeism](https://www.oysterhr.com/library/what-is-digital-presenteeism-and-how-to-avoid-it-on-a-remote-team)
**Affected group:** Remote and hybrid workers (especially those with surveillance-minded managers)
**Current solutions:** Time-tracking tools that CONTRIBUTE to the problem. Managers tracking green dots. No tool helps shift to outcome-based measurement.
**Evidence of growth:** 67 min/day wasted. 5.5 hours/week lost per worker. 27% fewer meaningful tasks completed. Problem intensifies as companies mandate hybrid but measure presence, not output.

---

## Problem 6: Third Place Disappearance & Community Connection Crisis

**Pain level:** 8/10
**Frequency:** Daily (chronic loneliness)
**Trend:** Accelerating -- 79% of Gen Z report loneliness; friendship apps raised $16M in 2025
**Description:** Informal gathering spaces (coffee shops, community centers, parks) are vanishing due to rising rents, hostile urban design, and digital displacement. Without these "third places," social isolation increases. One-third of Americans feel lonely weekly. 60% of young adults (18-24) report negative wellbeing effects from loneliness.
**Source:** [CNU - Fighting loneliness with third places](https://www.cnu.org/publicsquare/2025/01/14/fighting-loneliness-parks-and-third-places) | [Science Array - Vanishing spaces](https://society.sciencearray.com/vanishing-third-places-community-gathering-spaces) | [TechCrunch - Clyx raised $14M](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/this-gen-z-founded-app-just-raised-14m-to-take-on-the-loneliness-episdemic/) | [NPR - Lonely, there's an app for that](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/20/nx-s1-5328750/lonely-theres-an-app-for-that)
**Affected group:** Gen Z (79% lonely), young adults, remote workers, urban dwellers
**Current solutions:** Friendship apps (Clyx, Wyzr, TimeLeft) -- but experts note algorithms favor engagement over genuine connection. Meetup.com exists but feels transactional. None truly replicate the spontaneous, low-stakes connection of third places.
**Evidence of growth:** Friendship apps: $16M revenue, 4.3M downloads in 2025. Clyx: 50K active users, $14M Series A. Surgeon General declared loneliness an epidemic (2023). Problem continues worsening.

---

## Problem 7: Notification & Communication Overload

**Pain level:** 7/10
**Frequency:** Daily (every 30 minutes)
**Trend:** Worsening as tool count increases; 77% of workers find notifications distracting
**Description:** Workers are drowning in notifications across Slack, Teams, email, project tools, and now AI assistants. 48% are pulled away from work every 30 minutes. Same updates arrive through multiple channels causing confusion. Remote teams across time zones see async messages stack up for days, blockers go unresolved, and critical info gets buried.
**Source:** [The HR Director - Remote work challenges](https://www.thehrdirector.com/challenges-remote-work-2025-overcome/) | [Remote Sparks - Async tools](https://www.remotesparks.com/async-communication-tools/)
**Affected group:** All knowledge workers; especially remote/hybrid teams and managers
**Current solutions:** Slack/Teams have notification settings. Apps like Clockwise manage calendar. But no tool provides intelligent cross-platform notification triage -- prioritizing what actually matters and silencing noise.
**Evidence of growth:** 77% find notifications distracting. 48% interrupted every 30 min. Average company uses 85+ SaaS apps. Each one sends notifications. The problem scales linearly with tool adoption.

---

## Problem 8: Cookie Consent & Compliance Fatigue (Users)

**Pain level:** 6/10
**Frequency:** Daily (15-20 banners per browsing session)
**Trend:** Growing -- EU Digital Omnibus (Nov 2025) explicitly acknowledges consent fatigue; 1000+ banners/year per user
**Description:** Users encounter 15-20 cookie banners per session, 1000+ per year. 72% of implementations use dark patterns to manipulate consent. 68.9% of users just dismiss or blindly accept. The EU recognized this is broken and proposed centralized consent management in Nov 2025, but implementation is years away.
**Source:** [CookieScript - Consent fatigue strategies](https://cookie-script.com/news/consent-fatigue-strategies-to-improve-user-experience-and-boost-opt-in-rates) | [CookieLawInfo - Cookie consent fatigue](https://www.cookielawinfo.com/cookie-consent-fatigue/) | [Nixon Digital - From banners to signals](https://www.nixondigital.io/blog/en/cookie-banners-consent-signals-2026/)
**Affected group:** Every internet user in the EU (and increasingly globally)
**Current solutions:** Browser extensions exist but are unreliable. The EU proposed browser-level consent signals but won't be implemented until ~2027-2028. No good interim solution.
**Evidence of growth:** 72% of banners contain dark patterns. EU acknowledging the problem officially. Regulatory reform underway but slow. Users increasingly frustrated and privacy-numb.

---

## Problem 9: Gen Z Workplace Friction & Financial Insecurity

**Pain level:** 7/10
**Frequency:** Daily
**Trend:** Intensifying -- financial insecurity jumped from 30% (2024) to 48% (2025)
**Description:** Gen Z workers face a triple squeeze: financial insecurity (48% don't feel secure, up from 30% in 2024), generational workplace tension (47% judged for being "too passionate"), and AI threatening the entry-level work they need to learn. Half live paycheck to paycheck. They want purpose, flexibility, and ethics -- but get legacy systems and presenteeism culture.
**Source:** [Interview Guys - State of Gen Z 2025](https://blog.theinterviewguys.com/the-state-of-gen-z-in-the-workplace-2025/) | [HR Dive - Generational tensions](https://www.hrdive.com/news/younger-employees-report-generational-tensions-at-work/807383/) | [Checkr - Future of Work](https://checkr.com/resources/articles/future-of-work-2025-report)
**Affected group:** Gen Z workers (born 1997-2012), now 27% of the workforce
**Current solutions:** Generic career advice, financial literacy apps (not tailored to Gen Z gig/hybrid reality), mentorship programs that don't scale.
**Evidence of growth:** Financial insecurity: 30% -> 48% in one year. 47% judged at work. 30% received zero recognition in past week. 24% feel opinions don't matter. Turnover risk is extremely high.

---

## Problem 10: Freelancer Financial Chaos

**Pain level:** 7/10
**Frequency:** Weekly/Monthly (tax deadlines, invoicing cycles)
**Trend:** Worsening -- new IRS 1099-K threshold ($600 in 2025, down from $20K), Trump-era tax cuts expiring end 2025
**Description:** Freelancers face a perfect storm: messy invoicing, late payments from clients, complex self-employment taxes (15.3%), new reporting thresholds, feast-or-famine income cycles, and platform fees of 5-20%. The new $600 1099-K threshold means even tiny gig income triggers reporting. 2026 tax changes mean higher rates and narrower brackets.
**Source:** [NerdWallet - Freelancer Taxes](https://www.nerdwallet.com/taxes/learn/freelance-taxes) | [UncleKam - 2026 Freelancer Tax Changes](https://unclekam.com/2026-tax-changes/2026-freelancer-tax-changes/) | [AllWork - 2026 Tax Bracket Changes](https://allwork.space/2025/11/what-the-u-s-2026-tax-bracket-changes-mean-for-remote-and-freelance-workers/)
**Affected group:** 76.4 million freelancers in the US (2025), growing annually
**Current solutions:** Tools exist (FreshBooks, Wave, QuickBooks) but are designed for established businesses, not gig workers juggling 3 income streams. No tool simplifies tax estimation + invoicing + income smoothing in one place for solopreneurs.
**Evidence of growth:** Freelancer count growing 3-5% annually. 1099-K threshold dropped from $20K to $600. Tax code becoming more complex. Platform commission fees rising.

---

## Problem 11: Climate Anxiety-to-Action Gap

**Pain level:** 6/10
**Frequency:** Weekly (persistent background anxiety)
**Trend:** Steady and intensifying with extreme weather events; research confirms awareness-action inconsistency
**Description:** People are concerned about climate but paralyzed when it comes to action. They can't evaluate their own carbon footprints accurately, don't know which actions matter most, and feel overwhelmed by conflicting advice. Carbon tracking apps exist but feel like homework. The gap between "I care" and "I act" remains wide.
**Source:** [APA - Youth climate anxiety to action](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2025/06/youth-climate-anxiety-action) | [PMC - Overcoming awareness-action gap](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11183022/) | [Yale Climate Connections - Young people suffering](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2025/01/young-people-are-suffering-from-climate-anxiety-heres-how-to-help/)
**Affected group:** Environmentally conscious consumers (especially Gen Z/Millennials), estimated 40-60% of population
**Current solutions:** Carbon tracking apps (Commons/Joro, Klima, AWorld) exist but have low long-term engagement. Research shows tracking alone reduces emissions by 23%, but novelty wears off. No app successfully bridges anxiety -> meaningful action at scale.
**Evidence of growth:** Climate anxiety rising with each extreme weather event. Gen Z most affected. Apps growing but engagement plateaus after weeks.

## Problem 12: Creator Economy Monetization Fragmentation

**Pain level:** 7/10
**Frequency:** Daily
**Trend:** Intensifying as platforms multiply (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, X, Threads, Bluesky, LinkedIn, Substack, etc.)
**Description:** Creators must manage 5-8 platforms simultaneously. Each has different content formats, analytics dashboards, monetization rules, and audience behaviors. 58.3% of creators face monetization challenges. Revenue consolidates to top creators while the "long tail" gets squeezed. Analytics are siloed -- no unified view of performance across platforms.
**Source:** [Epidemic Sound - Future Creator Economy 2025](https://www.epidemicsound.com/business/future-creator-economy-report-2025/) | [Marketing LTB - Creator Economy Stats](https://marketingltb.com/blog/statistics/creator-economy-statistics/) | [Quasa.io - Creator Monetization Landscape](https://quasa.io/media/the-2025-creator-monetization-landscape-insights-from-a-key-survey-and-broader-trends)
**Affected group:** 50+ million content creators worldwide; especially mid-tier creators (10K-100K followers)
**Current solutions:** Cross-posting tools exist (Buffer, Hootsuite, Later) but handle scheduling, not strategy. No tool provides unified cross-platform analytics + revenue tracking + content optimization in one dashboard tailored for individual creators (not agencies).
**Evidence of growth:** Creator economy market projected to reach $528B by 2030. Platform count increasing. 62.3% face difficulty aligning content with monetization. Revenue fragmentation getting worse.

---

## Problem 13: Remote Onboarding Failure

**Pain level:** 6/10
**Frequency:** Per new hire (but affects retention for months)
**Trend:** Persistent problem that hasn't been solved despite 5 years of remote work
**Description:** 33% of new remote hires start looking for another job within 6 months. 63% of remote workers feel undertrained vs. 38% of on-site workers. New hires miss organic learning moments -- spontaneous conversations, shadowing, lunch connections. One-fifth of all turnover happens within 45 days.
**Source:** [Training Mag - Onboarding Pitfalls](https://trainingmag.com/reflecting-on-5-years-of-remote-work-the-onboarding-pitfalls/) | [Valamis - Remote Onboarding Challenges](https://www.valamis.com/blog/challenges-of-remote-onboarding)
**Affected group:** New remote/hybrid employees and their managers; HR teams
**Current solutions:** BambooHR, Sapling, and similar HR tools handle paperwork but not cultural integration. AI onboarding assistants emerging but early stage. No tool replicates the "buddy system" or spontaneous learning of in-office onboarding.
**Evidence of growth:** 20% of turnover in first 45 days. 33% job-hunting within 6 months. The cost of each failed onboarding: 50-200% of annual salary.

---

## Problem 14: GDPR/Privacy Compliance Burden for SMEs

**Pain level:** 6/10
**Frequency:** Ongoing (with spikes around audits, incidents, regulatory changes)
**Trend:** Getting MORE complex -- EU Digital Omnibus adds new rules even as it tries to simplify
**Description:** GDPR compliance costs function like a 25% tax on small companies. Costs range from $1.7M for small firms to $70M for larger ones. Small e-commerce businesses find guidance outdated, overly technical, or too generic. New regulations (AI Act, Data Act, Digital Services Act) compound the burden. 95% of businesses that struggle most are SMEs.
**Source:** [LSE Business Review - Why GDPR still difficult](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2025/08/01/why-is-gdpr-compliance-still-so-difficult/) | [Sprinto - GDPR for small companies 2026](https://sprinto.com/blog/gdpr-for-small-companies/) | [Richt Law - 2026 Privacy Landscape](https://richtfirm.com/the-2026-privacy-law-and-compliance-state-of-play-navigating-an-increasingly-complex-regulatory-landscape/)
**Affected group:** SMEs in the EU (95% of all businesses), especially e-commerce and SaaS startups
**Current solutions:** Compliance platforms (OneTrust, CookieBot, Didomi) are expensive and enterprise-focused. No affordable, simple, "GDPR for dummies" tool exists for micro-businesses.
**Evidence of growth:** EU Digital Omnibus (Nov 2025) adds new requirements while trying to simplify. AI Act adds AI-specific compliance. Data Act adds data sharing obligations. The regulatory stack keeps growing.

---

## Problem 15: Sustainable Choice Overwhelm

**Pain level:** 5/10
**Frequency:** Daily (shopping, eating, traveling decisions)
**Trend:** Growing as more "eco" options flood the market with competing claims
**Description:** Consumers want to make sustainable choices but face greenwashing, conflicting eco-labels, and decision paralysis. Is organic better than local? Is recycled plastic better than bamboo? People over- or under-estimate the climate impact of their decisions because the information is fragmented and contradictory. Carbon tracking apps help but feel like homework rather than seamless guidance.
**Source:** [PMC - Overcoming awareness-action gap](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11183022/) | [Green.earth - Carbon tracking apps 2025](https://www.green.earth/blog/our-favourite-carbon-tracking-apps-tools-and-plugins-2025-edition)
**Affected group:** Environmentally conscious consumers (growing demographic)
**Current solutions:** Carbon calculators, eco-label databases, sustainable product guides -- all fragmented. No point-of-purchase tool that instantly tells you "this choice is better because X" in the moment of decision.
**Evidence of growth:** Number of eco-labels and certifications multiplying. Consumer confusion rising. Greenwashing lawsuits increasing. Demand for simplicity and trust.

---

## Problem 16: Meeting Fatigue (Persists)

**Pain level:** 6/10
**Frequency:** Daily
**Trend:** Slightly shifting but still unsolved -- 83% of employees spend up to 1/3 of workweek in meetings
**Description:** Despite years of discussion, meeting overload persists. 63% of remote workers attend more meetings than they would in-office. 30% spend 2-3 hours daily on camera. Women are 2.5x more likely to experience Zoom fatigue than men. The problem isn't video per se -- it's poorly run, unnecessary meetings that could be async.
**Source:** [Notta - Meeting Statistics 2025](https://www.notta.ai/en/blog/meeting-statistics) | [Fellow.ai - Meeting Statistics](https://fellow.ai/blog/meeting-statistics-the-future-of-meetings-report/) | [Nature - Zoom fatigue research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-90973-6)
**Affected group:** All knowledge workers; women and introverts disproportionately affected
**Current solutions:** Meeting cost calculators, Clockwise for scheduling, AI note-takers (Otter, Fireflies). But no tool effectively prevents unnecessary meetings or converts meetings-that-should-be-emails into async formats.
**Evidence of growth:** 83% of employees in meetings 1/3 of their week. Despite AI note-takers, meeting count hasn't decreased. The problem is cultural, not just technological.

---

## Problem 17: Remote Work Isolation & Disconnection

**Pain level:** 7/10
**Frequency:** Daily
**Trend:** Persistent -- 42% of remote workers say loneliness is their biggest struggle
**Description:** Feelings of disconnection remain the biggest challenge for hybrid/remote teams. 42% say loneliness is their top struggle. 21% worry about proximity bias. Cultural integration is nearly impossible over Slack. 46% of remote workers would quit if forced back to office, creating a no-win situation for companies.
**Source:** [HBR - Hybrid Still Isn't Working](https://hbr.org/2025/07/hybrid-still-isnt-working) | [HR Executive - What 2025 revealed](https://hrexecutive.com/what-2025-revealed-about-remote-hybrid-and-office-work/) | [Interview Guys - State of Remote Work 2025](https://blog.theinterviewguys.com/state-of-remote-work-2025/)
**Affected group:** Remote and hybrid workers worldwide (estimated 35-40% of workforce)
**Current solutions:** Virtual water coolers (Donut, Watercooler Trivia) -- low engagement. Team-building platforms (Teamflow, Gather) -- novelty wears off. No solution sustainably replicates organic relationship-building.
**Evidence of growth:** 42% lonely. 67% struggle with video tech setup. 21% fear proximity bias. 46% would quit over RTO mandates. The tension between flexibility and connection remains unresolved.

## Gotchas & Considerations

- **AI-related problems are the freshest** but risk being seen as "another AI tool" -- positioning matters enormously
- **Loneliness/community problems** are emotionally resonant and get good hackathon reception (People's Choice potential) but harder to demo in 5 minutes
- **Regulatory compliance tools** have a strong market but are boring to demo at a hackathon
- **Creator economy tools** require multiple API integrations that may take more than 5 days
- **The AI intensification problem is only 4 days old** (HBR article: Feb 9, 2026) -- riding this wave could be extremely timely

## Key Insight: The Meta-Problem

Many of these problems share a root cause: **technology creates more work, more noise, and more cognitive load while promising the opposite.** The winning product might not solve a single symptom but address the underlying pattern: helping humans maintain agency, focus, and genuine connection in an increasingly automated, noisy, and fragmented world.

## Recommendations

### Top 3 for Vibe Coding Games (5-day MVP feasibility + impact):

1. **AI Work Intensity Tracker** -- A personal dashboard that tracks your AI usage patterns, detects workload creep (more tasks, longer hours, more context-switching), and prompts intentional breaks. Think "Screen Time for AI work patterns." Timely (HBR article is 4 days old), novel, and buildable in 5 days with a simple Chrome extension + dashboard.

2. **FOBO Score / AI-Proof Career Planner** -- Take a 2-minute assessment of your role, skills, and industry. Get a personalized "obsolescence risk score" with a concrete reskilling roadmap. Match against real job market data. Addresses a fear 52% of workers share. Simple quiz + scoring algorithm + actionable output.

3. **AI Slop Detector / Human Content Finder** -- Browser extension or search overlay that flags AI-generated content and highlights verified human-created content. Rides the "AI slop" wave (Merriam-Webster WOTY 2025). Could use stylometric analysis, metadata checking, or simple heuristics. Visual and demo-able.

### Honorable mention for hackathon:
4. **Third Place Radar** -- Find nearby informal community spaces where spontaneous connection happens. Not events (that's Meetup), but spaces where you can just... be around people. Coffee shops with communal tables, free library spaces, community gardens, public plazas. Emotionally compelling, People's Choice potential.
