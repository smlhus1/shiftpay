# Research: The Vibe Coding Games (February 2026)

> Researched: 2026-02-12 | Sources consulted: 25+ | Confidence: High (primary source verified via live website)

## TL;DR

The Vibe Coding Games is a global competition for **non-technical professionals** running **February 4-25, 2026**, organized by Harold Dijkstra and Ash Amplifies. Participants use AI coding assistants to build software products in 5 days (Feb 18-23), competing across 10 award categories including Best Business Use Case, Best SaaS, Best Mobile App, and more. Registration is free, teams of up to 2 allowed, and 1,007+ people have already joined. Gold sponsors are Netlify and Softr. **No specific "health and social work" industry category was found on the website** -- but the "Best Business Use Case" category is the natural fit for health/social work projects.

## 1. What Is It?

The Vibe Coding Games is a global competition that celebrates the ability of **non-technical professionals** to build software, apps, and tools to solve challenges. It is explicitly inspired by the Olympics -- participants represent their country and earn points on a national leaderboard.

**Key identity points:**
- NOT a game jam (despite the name) -- this is about building **real products** (SaaS, mobile apps, marketplaces, tools, etc.)
- Targeted at **non-technical** people who use AI to code (vibe coding)
- Themed around the **2026 Winter Olympics** (curling imagery, opening/closing ceremonies, country representation)
- First edition of this specific event

**What is "vibe coding"?**
Vibe coding is a term coined by Andrej Karpathy (OpenAI co-founder) in February 2025, describing a development approach where you describe what you want in natural language and let AI generate the code. From the FAQ: "For most beginners this looks like typing your requirements into a box and letting an AI agent update the code for you."

## 8. Past Winners

**This is the first edition** of The Vibe Coding Games, so there are no past winners.

### Related Competition Winners (for reference)

The **2025 Vibe Coding Game Jam** (by @levelsio / Pieter Levels) is a different event but gives context for what quality looks like:
- 10,000+ game submissions
- Judges included Andrej Karpathy, Tim Soret, Mr.doob (Ricardo Cabello)
- Prize pool: $10,000 first / $5,000 second / $2,500 third
- Third prize: "Chicken Egg Adventure" (farm management game)

**Note:** That event was about **games** specifically and required **80%+ AI-generated code**. The Vibe Coding Games is broader (any product type) and targets non-technical people.

## 9. Tips and Strategies

Based on research across vibe coding competitions and expert advice:

### General Vibe Coding Tips (from Peter Yang's "12 Rules")
1. **Be specific with prompts** -- "Dodging comets in a neon sky" beats "space game"
2. **Stack features slowly** -- add one mechanic/feature at a time
3. **Provide context to AI** -- paste relevant docs into the AI's context
4. **Use version control early** -- commit at every milestone with git
5. **Keep projects lean** -- stay within the AI's context window
6. **Use visual references** -- include screenshots to show AI what you want
7. **Avoid context overload** -- start fresh chats for each feature
8. **Choose the right tools** -- match the tool to the task

### Strategy Specific to The Vibe Coding Games

Given the judging criteria (creativity, traction, problem-solving, UX, design, vibe):

1. **Focus on "traction"** -- this is unusual for a hackathon. Having real users or signups during the 5-day window could be a differentiator
2. **Solve a REAL problem** -- "Best Business Use Case" rewards practical solutions. For health/social work, find a genuine pain point
3. **Polish the UI** -- "Most Creative UI" and "Design" as judging criteria mean visual quality matters a lot
4. **Tell a compelling story** -- "People's Choice" is community-voted, so narrative matters
5. **Use the workshops** (Feb 9-13) -- the Maven workshops are designed to get you ready; take advantage of them
6. **Start planning NOW** -- you can't start building until Feb 18, but you can ideate and plan
7. **Keep scope tiny** -- with only 5 days and being non-technical, a focused MVP beats an ambitious mess
8. **Deploy on Netlify or Softr** -- as Gold Sponsors, using their platforms may be viewed favorably and gives you solid hosting

### For Health & Social Work Specifically
- Build something that **a real healthcare worker or social worker would use**
- Focus on a specific micro-problem (e.g., patient intake forms, shift handoff notes, client mood tracking)
- The "vibe" factor suggests the interface should feel delightful, not clinical
- Consider building on **Softr** (sponsor) which excels at internal tools and portals -- perfect for health/social work operational tools

## Gotchas & Considerations

1. **No specific "health and social work" category exists** -- you'll need to compete in general categories like Best Business Use Case or Best SaaS
2. **Prize details are vague** -- no confirmed monetary prizes; the emphasis is on learning and launching
3. **Only 5 days to build** (Feb 18-23) -- scope management is critical
4. **"Non-technical professionals" target audience** -- if you have any coding experience, you likely have an advantage, but this also means judges may value simplicity and UX over technical complexity
5. **"Traction" is a judging criterion** -- this is unusual and suggests you should try to get actual users during the competition
6. **Multiple submissions allowed** -- but all must start during the competition period and they will verify this
7. **First edition event** -- no precedent for judging standards, but also an opportunity to set the bar
8. **The workshops (Feb 9-13) are on Maven** -- they may require separate registration
9. **This is NOT the same as the "2025 Vibe Coding Game Jam"** by @levelsio -- that was a game-specific event with different rules

---

## Recommendations

### For competing in "health and social work":

1. **Register immediately** at [forms.thevibecodinggames.com/signup](https://forms.thevibecodinggames.com/signup)
2. **Attend the workshops** (Feb 9-13) -- free Maven sessions to learn vibe coding fundamentals
3. **Target "Best Business Use Case"** as your primary category -- build something that solves a real health/social work problem
4. **Secondary categories:** Also aim for Best SaaS or Best Internal Tool depending on what you build
5. **Start ideating NOW** -- you can't build until Feb 18, but research your problem space, talk to potential users, and plan your MVP
6. **Use the sponsor tools** -- Softr (Gold Sponsor) is ideal for building internal tools and portals, which is a natural fit for health/social work operations
7. **Keep scope razor-focused** -- one feature, done brilliantly, beats a half-finished platform
8. **Get real users during the 5 days** -- "traction" is a judging criterion, so deploy early and get people using it
9. **Represent Norway** -- not currently in the top 10, so every point counts
