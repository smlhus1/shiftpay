### The 90-Second Pitch

"Raise your hand if you've Googled 'will AI replace my job.' Yeah, me too.

Every tool out there gives you a RISK score. '72% chance of automation!' Great, now you're depressed AND unemployed.

We flipped it. Career Fitness Tracker gives you a RESILIENCE score. Take a 2-minute quiz about what you ACTUALLY do every day -- not your job title -- and get:

1. A Career Fitness Score (0-100)
2. Your skill portfolio visualized like a stock portfolio
3. The ONE skill that would boost your score the most
4. A 30-day action plan

And the best part? You can share your score. It's already going viral."

|------|-----|
| "72% automation risk!" (paralyzing) | "Career Fitness: 73!" (motivating) |
| Job title lookup (generic) | Task-level assessment (personal) |

| Marketing funnel for bootcamps | Independent, unbiased tool |
| Used once, forgotten | Shareable, track progress over time |

## Why Norgeskartet is the Runner-Up

| Criteria | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Creativity | 10/10 - Genuinely novel, zero competition globally |
| Traction potential | 7/10 - 40-55K/year arrivals, but niche market |
| Problem-solving | 9/10 - Real, documented, painful bureaucracy chaos |
| UX/Design | 7/10 - High ceiling if UX is amazing, risky if mediocre |
| Overall vibe | 9/10 - Emotionally powerful, socially impactful |
| 5-day buildability | 6/10 - Content research eats 2+ days |
| **Total** | **48/60** |

### When to pick Norgeskartet instead:
- If the team has a STRONG UI/UX designer who can make the quest map beautiful
- If judges value social impact and novelty over viral mechanics
- If the team speaks Norwegian and can validate content accuracy
- If the team has personal experience with immigration (authentic story)

## Killed Concepts (and why)

### AI Speed Governor - KILLED
- 4+ Chrome extensions already track/block AI usage
- Negative value prop ("we'll slow you down")
- Solves wrong problem (people need to manage expectations, not reduce AI use)

### AI Slop Detector - KILLED (in Fase 3)
- GPTZero already has a browser extension
- Accuracy is make-or-break, impossible in 5 days
- Detection technology is unreliable (fails on paraphrased text)

### Immigrant Settlement Navigator (non-gamified) - ABSORBED into Norgeskartet
- Static checklist version is boring
- Quest map version (Norgeskartet) is the creative upgrade
