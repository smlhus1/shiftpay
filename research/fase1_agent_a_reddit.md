# Reddit & Forum Mining: Real Unsolved Problems

> Researched: 2026-02-13 | Sources consulted: 35+ | Scope: Standard research (15+ web searches, 2 deep page fetches)

## TL;DR

The most promising MVP opportunities for a 5-day hackathon combine **high daily frequency**, **emotional weight**, and **inadequate existing solutions**. Top picks are: contractor quoting/estimate tools, small landlord property management, personal finance for multi-income freelancers, meeting action item accountability, and ADHD-friendly productivity tools. These all have massive Reddit validation with thousands of frustrated users, and can be scoped to a buildable MVP.

---

## Problem 1: Contractor Quote & Estimate Generator
**Pain level:** 9/10
**Frequency:** Daily (for active contractors)
**Description:** Plumbers, electricians, and handymen waste hours creating quotes, sometimes emailing bids to wrong clients (exposing personal data). They need a fast, branded, secure way to generate professional estimates from job details -- enter labor + materials, get a PDF in minutes. Current tools are either enterprise-scale or unreliable.
**Source:** r/Plumbing, r/Electricians, r/Handyman, r/Contractors (via Medium analysis of 50+ subreddits)
**Affected group:** Trades workers / independent contractors (~5.5M in US)
**Current solutions:** Generic invoicing tools (Wave, FreshBooks) are too broad; trade-specific tools are overpriced or buggy. Many still use paper or Word docs.
**Upvote/agreement signal:** Recurring theme across multiple trade subreddits; featured in multiple "ideas from Reddit" roundups. One plumber's story about a quoting app exposing client data went viral.

---

## Problem 2: Small Landlord Property Management (< 10 units)
**Pain level:** 8/10
**Frequency:** Weekly
**Description:** Landlords managing fewer than 10 rental units are drowning -- forgetting HVAC inspections, missing pest control schedules, losing track of expenses, and dealing with fake pay stubs from tenants. Big platforms like Buildium and AppFolio are designed for 50+ unit portfolios and priced accordingly.
**Source:** r/Landlord, r/PropertyManagement, r/RealEstate
**Affected group:** Small-scale landlords (~72.5% of single-unit rentals owned by individuals)
**Current solutions:** Spreadsheets, Google Calendar reminders, or enterprise PM tools that are overkill. Nothing purpose-built for 1-10 units at $10-20/mo.
**Upvote/agreement signal:** "Endless posts" on r/Landlord about forgetting maintenance; consistent theme in multiple Reddit idea analyses.

---

## Problem 3: Financial Dashboard for Multi-Income Freelancers
**Pain level:** 9/10
**Frequency:** Daily
**Description:** Freelancers and solopreneurs running 3-4 income streams (clients, affiliate programs, digital products) can't track revenue across platforms, understand actual profitability, or prepare for taxes. Traditional accounting software assumes one business entity. Every week on r/entrepreneur someone posts about this exact struggle.
**Source:** r/Entrepreneur, r/freelance, r/IndieHackers
**Affected group:** Freelancers, solopreneurs, indie hackers (~70M+ globally)
**Current solutions:** "I use a combination of 5 different tools and it still sucks" is the universal response. QuickBooks/Xero built for traditional businesses; Wave too basic; nothing aggregates multi-platform income.
**Upvote/agreement signal:** Weekly recurring posts in r/Entrepreneur with dozens of "same here" responses.

---

## Problem 4: Meeting Action Item Accountability Tracker
**Pain level:** 8/10
**Frequency:** Daily (in office environments)
**Description:** Teams walk out of meetings with decisions made and action items assigned, but nothing happens. Tasks disappear into a black hole. Follow-up emails get buried. No one tracks who owns what or when it's due. Next meeting revisits the same topics.
**Source:** r/ProductManagement, r/projectmanagement, r/Entrepreneur, multiple productivity forums
**Affected group:** Knowledge workers, managers, team leads (~1B+ globally)
**Current solutions:** Meeting notes in various apps, follow-up emails that get buried, Notion/Asana too heavyweight for this specific use case. Nothing automatically extracts action items and sends reminders.
**Upvote/agreement signal:** Major theme across workplace productivity subreddits; BuzzFeed article on unsolved modern inconveniences cited meetings as top frustration.

---

## Problem 5: ADHD-Friendly Productivity System
**Pain level:** 9/10
**Frequency:** Daily
**Description:** Every productivity app is designed for neurotypical brains. ADHD users get the dopamine hit from downloading new tools, experience brief excitement, then abandon them. They need simple yet engaging, not complex. Apps that are too simple bore them; too complex overwhelms them. The average person switches apps 1,100 times daily -- for ADHD brains this creates catastrophic "attention residue."
**Source:** r/ADHD, r/productivity, r/GetMotivated (multiple analyses citing these)
**Affected group:** Adults with ADHD (~10% of US adults, ~30M people)
**Current solutions:** Focused apps like Focusmate, Forest exist for specific tactics. Generic to-do apps fail. One user deleted 47 productivity apps in 30 days. Nothing combines the right balance of simplicity + engagement + ADHD-specific design.
**Upvote/agreement signal:** One Medium article about deleting 47 apps went viral; ADHD communities are among the most active on Reddit discussing tool failures.

---

## Problem 6: Nursing Documentation Burden Reducer
**Pain level:** 10/10
**Frequency:** Every shift (daily)
**Description:** Nurses spend 19-40% of a 12-hour shift documenting patient care. They record data in 600+ flowsheet rows, often double-charting in flowsheets AND end-of-shift notes. 90% say EHR hurts nurse-patient communication. 47% report high burnout, with documentation being a primary driver.
**Source:** r/nursing (2.1M members), KLAS Research, AACN, PMC studies
**Affected group:** Nurses (~4.7M in US alone)
**Current solutions:** Epic, Cerner, and other EHR systems that nurses universally hate. Too many options in flowsheets, inconsistent workflows, forced double-charting. AI scribes emerging but not widely deployed.
**Upvote/agreement signal:** r/nursing has 2.1M members; documentation burden is the single most discussed technical frustration; KLAS published a 2025 report specifically on this.

---

## Problem 7: Adult Friendship / Social Connection Platform
**Pain level:** 8/10
**Frequency:** Ongoing (weekly attempts)
**Description:** Making friends as an adult is nearly impossible, especially after college, in a new city, or with remote work. Apps like Bumble BFF, Meetup exist but have major issues -- age mismatches, low engagement, feeling like dating apps repurposed for friendship. The US Surgeon General declared loneliness a public health crisis.
**Source:** r/socialskills, r/MakeNewFriendsHere, r/Adulting (consistent recurring theme)
**Affected group:** Adults 25-45 in new cities or remote workers (~35M remote workers in US)
**Current solutions:** Bumble BFF (dating app feel), Meetup (age mismatches, low quality groups), Facebook Groups (declining engagement). $16M in consumer spending on friendship apps but none dominate.
**Upvote/agreement signal:** Posts about adult loneliness routinely get 50K-200K upvotes on Reddit. Listed as #1 most requested app on r/SomebodyMakeThis analysis.

---

## Problem 8: Teacher Technology Overload Manager
**Pain level:** 8/10
**Frequency:** Daily
**Description:** Teachers are forced to use too many edtech tools, often duplicating work (upload lesson plans to LMS AND submit paper copies). Standards-based grading protocols in student information systems are called a "joke." LMS platforms make teachers more tired, not more efficient. Some schools require 10+ different platforms daily.
**Source:** r/teachers (390K subscribers), EdSurge, Edutopia
**Affected group:** K-12 teachers (~3.7M in US)
**Current solutions:** Canvas, Schoology, Google Classroom -- each adding complexity without reducing workload. No tool that simplifies/unifies the teacher's daily workflow across platforms.
**Upvote/agreement signal:** r/teachers has 390K subscribers with shift toward increasingly frustrated tone. EdSurge featured "teachers share anger with technology" article.

---

## Problem 9: Subscription Tracker & Cancellation Helper
**Pain level:** 7/10
**Frequency:** Monthly (when charges hit)
**Description:** People forget to cancel free trials and unwanted subscriptions. The FTC receives ~70 consumer complaints per day about recurring subscriptions (up from 42/day in 2021). Companies deliberately make cancellation harder than signup. Users want a dashboard showing ALL active subscriptions with 1-click cancel and pre-renewal alerts.
**Source:** r/personalfinance, r/Frugal, consumer complaints databases
**Affected group:** General consumers (average person has 12+ active subscriptions)
**Current solutions:** Truebill/Rocket Money and Trim exist but require bank account access (privacy concern), take a cut of savings, or miss subscriptions. Apple/Google show some but not all.
**Upvote/agreement signal:** 70 FTC complaints/day growing trend; regular front-page posts about being charged after "canceling."

---

## Problem 10: Home Maintenance Scheduling & Tracking
**Pain level:** 7/10
**Frequency:** Monthly (but consequences are long-term and expensive)
**Description:** Homeowners forget when filters need changing, when HVAC was last serviced, when the roof was inspected. They use sticky notes on appliances and scattered Google Calendar reminders. When something breaks, they can't find warranty info or service records. First-time homeowners especially overwhelmed.
**Source:** r/homeowners, r/HomeImprovement, MetaFilter
**Affected group:** Homeowners (~130M in US)
**Current solutions:** HomeZada, Househappy exist but are either too complex or poorly maintained. Most people use scattered reminders or nothing at all. Appliance manuals get lost.
**Upvote/agreement signal:** Regular threads on r/homeowners asking "how do you track this?" with multiple people sharing homegrown systems.

---

## Problem 11: Airbnb Turnover / Cleaning Coordinator
**Pain level:** 8/10
**Frequency:** Multiple times per week (for active hosts)
**Description:** Airbnb and vacation rental hosts still use spreadsheets to schedule cleaners between guest checkouts and check-ins. When a booking calendar changes, the cleaning schedule breaks. No good tool auto-syncs with booking platforms and assigns cleanings with SMS notifications.
**Source:** r/AirBnB, r/VacationRental (via Medium Reddit analysis)
**Affected group:** Short-term rental hosts (~1.5M listings in US alone)
**Current solutions:** Spreadsheets, group texts, manually checking booking calendars. Turno/TurnoverBnB exists but limited and glitchy according to users.
**Upvote/agreement signal:** "Many admit they still use spreadsheets" -- consistent complaint across host communities.

---

## Problem 12: Skill Exchange / Barter Platform
**Pain level:** 6/10
**Frequency:** Monthly (when need arises)
**Description:** "I'll teach you guitar if you teach me Spanish" -- people want to trade skills instead of paying for lessons. This concept gets massive upvotes every time it's posted but nobody has built a successful platform because the matching problem is hard and monetization unclear.
**Source:** r/SomebodyMakeThis, r/LifeProTips (recurring with 50K+ upvotes)
**Affected group:** Anyone wanting to learn new skills (broad)
**Current solutions:** Nothing purpose-built. Timebanking apps exist but are community-specific and clunky. SkillShare is one-directional (courses, not exchange).
**Upvote/agreement signal:** Consistently one of the most upvoted "somebody make this" ideas on Reddit with 50K-200K upvotes per occurrence.

---

## Problem 13: Glassdoor for Landlords / Rental Properties
**Pain level:** 8/10
**Frequency:** When renting (every 1-3 years, but HIGH stakes)
**Description:** Renters want to check a landlord's reputation before signing a lease, similar to Glassdoor for employers. Rate responsiveness, maintenance quality, deposit return fairness. Currently zero transparency -- you sign a lease hoping for the best.
**Source:** r/Tenant, r/ApartmentHacks, r/SomebodyMakeThis (thousands of upvotes)
**Affected group:** Renters (~44M renting households in US)
**Current solutions:** Two Redditors launched a basic site but it didn't gain traction. Some local Facebook groups share info. No dominant solution exists.
**Upvote/agreement signal:** Described as "Glassdoor meets Carfax for rental properties" -- consistent 50K+ upvote theme.

---

## Problem 14: Food Waste Reduction Marketplace
**Pain level:** 7/10
**Frequency:** Daily (food discarded daily)
**Description:** Restaurants and grocery stores throw away perfectly good food daily. People want an app where businesses post food about to expire at deep discounts, and nearby consumers can grab it. Hits Reddit values of environmentalism, saving money, and fighting corporate waste.
**Source:** r/ZeroWaste, r/Frugal, r/SomebodyMakeThis
**Affected group:** Environmentally conscious consumers + food service businesses
**Current solutions:** Too Good To Go exists in some markets but limited coverage and inconsistent quality. OLIO for community sharing but low adoption. Nothing dominant in most US cities.
**Upvote/agreement signal:** Recurring viral topic on Reddit; multiple cities have grassroots efforts.

---

## Problem 15: Makeup / Cosmetic Allergy & Reaction Tracker
**Pain level:** 7/10
**Frequency:** Weekly (when trying new products)
**Description:** 30M+ Americans have cosmetic allergies or sensitivities. They have no systematic way to track which products or ingredients cause reactions. Pattern recognition is nearly impossible without data. Current approach is painful trial and error with real skin health consequences.
**Source:** Beauty and skincare Reddit communities, BigIdeasDB analysis (500K+ data points)
**Affected group:** People with cosmetic allergies/sensitivities (~30M in US)
**Current solutions:** Beauty apps focus on reviews and ingredient lookups, NOT personal reaction tracking over time. No tool logs products used, tracks reactions, and identifies problematic ingredients via patterns.
**Upvote/agreement signal:** Validated through BigIdeasDB analysis of 500K+ data points across Reddit and G2 reviews. Listed as "easiest to build as solo founder" among validated ideas.

---

## Problem 16: Freelance Time Tracking Across Multiple Clients
**Pain level:** 7/10
**Frequency:** Daily
**Description:** Freelancers juggling 3-6 active clients describe time logs that "look like Swiss cheese with random gaps everywhere." Switching between clients makes accurate tracking nearly impossible. By end of day they can't reconstruct what they worked on. Existing tools require too much manual discipline.
**Source:** r/freelance, r/digitalnomad, MetaFilter
**Affected group:** Freelancers (~70M worldwide)
**Current solutions:** Toggl, Harvest, Clockify exist but require manual switching. RescueTime tracks automatically but can't distinguish client work. No tool combines auto-detection with client assignment.
**Upvote/agreement signal:** r/digitalnomad users describe spending 15 min daily "cleaning up" time logs; consistent frustration pattern.

---

## Problem 17: Volunteer Management for Small Nonprofits
**Pain level:** 7/10
**Frequency:** Weekly
**Description:** Nonprofit coordinators spend more time explaining how to use volunteer management systems than recruiting volunteers. When systems are confusing, volunteers call or email their availability -- coordinator manually enters everything while paying for automation they're not using. Almost half of nonprofit CEOs cite volunteer recruitment as a significant challenge.
**Source:** r/Nonprofit, r/ChurchTech, VolunteerHub analysis
**Affected group:** Small nonprofits and community organizations (~1.8M nonprofits in US)
**Current solutions:** Tools exist (VolunteerMatters, Galaxy Digital) but require training manuals and video tutorials. "If the software requires a manual, it's not intuitive." Free options are too basic; paid ones too complex.
**Upvote/agreement signal:** Coordinators report creating step-by-step guides just to help volunteers navigate the system -- universal complaint.

---

## Problem 18: Digital Photo / File Organization
**Pain level:** 6/10
**Frequency:** Weekly (but builds into overwhelming debt)
**Description:** People are drowning in digital clutter -- thousands of photos across devices, duplicate files, full storage warnings. ADHD users especially affected ("I have folders for my folders for my folders"). The paralysis of not knowing where to start prevents any action. Years of memories get lost or are unfindable.
**Source:** r/declutter, r/organization, r/ADHD, r/Photography
**Affected group:** Everyone with a smartphone (billions, but acute for ~500M+ with 5K+ photos)
**Current solutions:** Google Photos and Apple Photos auto-organize somewhat but can't handle cross-platform, deduplication, or intentional curation. No tool combines AI organization + cross-platform + simple UX.
**Upvote/agreement signal:** "We've all been there, drowning in a sea of digital clutter" -- Reddit user. Regular threads with hundreds of replies.

---

## Problem 19: Personal CRM / Relationship Manager
**Pain level:** 6/10
**Frequency:** Weekly
**Description:** People lose touch with friends, family, and professional contacts because there's no easy system for remembering when to reach out, what you talked about last, or important life events. Traditional CRMs are for sales. Personal relationship tracking needs a different UX focused on genuine human connection.
**Source:** r/socialskills, r/Networking, r/Productivity
**Affected group:** Professionals and adults maintaining social networks
**Current solutions:** Monica (open source, self-hosted -- too technical), Dex, Clay exist but either too expensive, too sales-oriented, or require too much manual input. Nothing lightweight and automatic.
**Upvote/agreement signal:** GitHub's Monica project has 22K+ stars; multiple personal CRM startups keep launching, indicating unsolved demand.

---

## Problem 20: Household Chore Fairness Tracker
**Pain level:** 7/10
**Frequency:** Daily
**Description:** 78% of roommate conflicts are about household chores. Everyone has a different definition of "clean." Without tracking, some roommates end up doing disproportionate work, creating resentment. The problem extends to couples too -- unequal domestic labor is a top relationship complaint.
**Source:** r/Roommates, r/relationships, r/AskWomen, NPR analysis
**Affected group:** Roommates and couples (~40M+ shared households in US)
**Current solutions:** FairChore and some chore chart apps exist but have low adoption. Most use paper charts or nothing. Points-based systems sound great but nobody maintains them manually.
**Upvote/agreement signal:** 78% conflict statistic widely cited; recurring theme in relationship and roommate subreddits.

---

## Cross-Cutting Patterns Observed

### Pattern 1: "Fewer features, not more"
The most common frustration across ALL industries is bloated tools. People are begging for simplicity. CRMs, property management, volunteer tools, EHR -- all too complex.

### Pattern 2: "The Middle Market Gap"
Enterprise solutions cost $500+/month. Free tools are too basic. The $10-50/month sweet spot for small teams/individuals is consistently underserved.

### Pattern 3: "I use 5 tools and it still sucks"
Integration and fragmentation is a universal pain point. People combine spreadsheets, calendar reminders, email, and specialized tools but nothing connects.

### Pattern 4: "Automate the boring parts, not the thinking"
Users don't want AI to replace them -- they want it to handle data entry, scheduling, reminders, and formatting while they focus on actual work.

### Pattern 5: "Community-validated = real demand"
Problems that surface independently across multiple subreddits, multiple times, over months/years represent genuine structural gaps, not fleeting complaints.
